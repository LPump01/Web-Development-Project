<h1>Web Development Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a combination of 2 assignments from separate courses while I attended the University of Louisville. In Computer Information Systems(CIS) 320, which was Systems Analysis and Design I drafted a prototype from scratch using HTML and CSS for a non-profit organization's website redesign. Although the course was overall a group project I solely did the prototype using Microsoft Visual Studio and the Live Server add-on to test my code and make changes as necessary. The prototype was presented 3 times to the organization and changes were made as requested. The following semester in CIS 420 - Web Development Project, in different groups we worked to develop a live site for this organization. The images show below represent the prototype developed in CIS 320, and the link goes to the live site created in CIS 420.
