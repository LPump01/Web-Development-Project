<h1>Web Development Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a combination of 2 assignment from seperate courses while I atteneded the University of Lousiville. In Computer Infortmation Systems(CIS) 320 which was Systems Analysis and Design I drafted a prototype from scratch using HTML and CSS for a non-profit organizations website redesign. Although the course was overall a group project I solely did the prototype using Microsft Visual Studio and the Live Server add on to test my code and make changes as necessary. The prototype was presented 3 times to the organization and changes were made as requested. The following semester in CIS 420 - Web Development Project, in different groups we worked to develop a live site for this organization. The images show below represent the prototype developed in CIS 320 and the link goes to the live site created in CIS 420.
